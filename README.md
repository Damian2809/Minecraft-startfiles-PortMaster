## Adding New Versions
If you want to add More versions please make sure that it does work out of the Box, like people get frustated very easily. So if possible make it so that the script itself renames folder and files or just work with the original name instead of 1.7.10-Forge just let it be Forge-1.7.10-2132qdawq
Another thing when adding new versions make sure to add it to the launcher.lua so it actually shows in the Launcher, if you add a ModLoader that is currently not supported and you dont know how to do this in lua, then just either ping me on discord or add it to the issues page
Last but not Least for yall, If the version has some huge bugs and/or only works on certain OSes because of XRANDR or OpenGL3 then please add it to the Notes Section later down. You also need to add yourself to the Credits section, yep its a must
If possible please post it on discord before so people can find it easier

## Playing more versions
If you want to Play More versions then i would firstly suggest downloading the whole zip, not only the .start file because you sometimes need more than that and also please read the Notes later down, they exist for a reason. If you encounter any issues then either come to the PortMaster discord or add the issue to the Issues Page

## When will the new versions come to PortMaster
After i checked that they work on Rocknix, MuOS and Knulli and someone else tested it on the discord Testing thread then i will consider to do a Pull Request on the Main PortMaster Repo
Also i Wont do a PR for just one version but if got like 2-5 then i will definetly make one
